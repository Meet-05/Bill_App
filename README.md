**Motive**:

This is a mobile application which was built to reduce the paper work of a local hardware shop owner .
Previously the shop owner had to manually write the bill, store the bills and if some customer came back after sometime he had to search that bill manually.
To make this process easy this applicaion was developed.

**Application Overview:**

The Application will store all the products and their prices.
Whenever a new customer arrives and the owner has to make a new bill, he/she can type the product name and add it in the bill.
All the products can be added in the bill in the similar way, the quantity and discount of each product can also be set.
Clicking on the print button will generate a pdf of the bill and it can be printed.
The owner can also track his daiily earnings.
Whenever a customer who bought products earlier comesback , <br />the owner doesn't need to manually check that bill in bill papers, insstead he can just search the customers name and find all the bill details (products purchased ,date).
